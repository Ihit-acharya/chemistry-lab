# Virtual Chemistry Lab – Essential UI, UX & QoL Features

## 1. Core UI Design Principles
- Clean, distraction-free interface focused on experiments
- Clear visual separation between workspace, controls, and information panels
- Consistent icons, colors, and interaction patterns
- Minimal text; rely on symbols, tooltips, and visuals
- High contrast for lab elements (chemicals, glassware, flames, reactions)

## 2. Lab Workspace Features
- Central experiment area (bench) with drag-and-drop support
- Interactive lab equipment:
  - Beakers, flasks, test tubes, burners, droppers, pipettes
- Scalable and zoomable workspace
- Realistic positioning and snapping of equipment
- Clear visual states (empty, filled, heating, reacting)

## 3. Chemical Management System
- Chemical inventory panel with:
  - Name, formula, state, hazard color
- Drag-to-add chemicals into containers
- Quantity control (slider or input)
- Chemical mixing detection
- Reaction state tracking (color change, gas, precipitate, heat)

## 4. Safety & Rule Enforcement
- Virtual safety rules:
  - Warnings for unsafe combinations
  - Spill and overflow prevention
- Visual hazard indicators
- Temperature and pressure limits
- Error feedback instead of silent failure

## 5. Interaction & Feedback

- Animated transitions (pouring, heating, bubbling)
- Tooltips explaining tools and chemicals
- Status messages (Heating…, Reaction Started, Cooling Down)
- Clear success / failure indicators

## 6. Quality of Life (QoL) Features
- Undo / redo actions
- Reset experiment button
- Save & load experiment states
- Pause / resume simulation
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Back-to-default lab setup

## 7. User Guidance & Learning Support
- Free-play sandbox mode
- Contextual hints (non-intrusive)
- Observation panel for notes
- Reaction equation display (when applicable)

## 8. Performance & Responsiveness
- Smooth animations without lag
- Fast loading of lab assets
- Optimized rendering for low-end devices
- Works on desktop and tablet screens

## 9. Accessibility & Usability
- Large, readable labels
- Keyboard and mouse support
- Touch-friendly controls
- Colorblind-safe indicators (not color-only cues)

## 10. Immersion & Realism
- Realistic lab sounds (optional)
- Accurate color changes and states
- Temperature and time-based reactions
- Cause-and-effect behavior (no fake reactions)

## 11. Developer / System Features
- Modular component-based design
- Easy addition of new chemicals and tools
- Clear state management
- Debug mode for testing reactions
